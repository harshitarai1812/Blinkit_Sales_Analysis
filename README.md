# Blinkit Sales Analysis (Python + Power BI)
## Overview
This project analyzes Blinkit sales data to uncover revenue trends, product performance, and outlet-level insights using Python for data analysis and Power BI for visualization.
The objective is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights that can support strategic decision-making.
## Business Objectives
* Analyze overall revenue performance
* Identify top-performing product categories
* Evaluate outlet-wise sales contribution
* Understand rating patterns and product performance
* Detect potential improvement areas in sales distribution
## Dataset
* Blinkit Sales Dataset
* 8,000+ records
* Tables used: Customers, Customer_order, Orders, Order_item, Products, Delivery_performance
## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Handled missing values
* Standardized inconsistent category labels
* Checked duplicates
* Converted data types where required
* Created derived metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, etc.)
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn:
## Revenue Analysis
* Total Revenue Calculation
* Sales by Establishment Year
* Average Sales per Item
## Product Analysis
* Sales by Item Type
* Fat Content impact on Sales
* Top & Bottom Performing Categories
## Ratings Insight
* Average Product Rating
* Relationship between Ratings and Sales
## Key Insights
* A small group of product categories drives majority of revenue.
* Medium-sized outlets generate higher overall sales.
* Tier 3 locations show strong sales performance.
* Some lower-rated items still perform well due to demand patterns.
## Tools & Technologies Used
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Power BI 
* Microsoft Excel (Initial data review)
